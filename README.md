Bag manipulation through robots is complex and challenging due to the deformability of the bag.
Based on dynamic manipulation strategy, we propose the ShakingBot for the bagging tasks.
Our approach utilizes a perception module to identify the key region of the plastic bag from arbitrary initial configurations. 
According to the segmentation, ShakingBot iteratively executes a set of actions, including Bag Adjustment, Dual-arm Shaking and One-arm Holding, to open the bag. Then, we insert the items and lift the bag for transport. 
We perform our method on a dual-arm robot and achieve a success rate of 21/33 for inserting at least one item across a variety of initial bag configurations.
In this work, we demonstrate the performance of dynamic shaking actions compared to the quasi-static manipulation in the bagging task.
We also show that our method generalizes to variations despite the bag's size, pattern, and color.

This repository contains code for training and evaluating ShakingBot in both simulation and real-world settings on a dual-UR5 robot arm setup for Ubuntu 18.04.
It has been tested on machines with Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.
